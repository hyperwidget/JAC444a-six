After creating the JAR files, I've imported the JAR files into Eclipse again.
I've checked that there's no compilation error.
I will lose 50% if that's not the case.

Java Version: build 1.6.0_30-b12

This program is a modified version of the software found at

This readme provides the basic steps required to properly extract the Jar files into a project in 
Eclipse. It assumes basic knowledge of creating a Java Project in Eclipse.

Unjar steps:

1) Create a new "Java Project" in Eclipse.
2) Right click on the project folder of the new project.
3) Select import from the menu.
4) Select "Archive File" as the import source (under General)
5) Select the provided jar file (jac444a - six.jar).
6) Click Finish.

After following these steps both: 
- Provider.GoogleMapsStatic
- Provider.GoogleMapsStatic.TestUI 

Should be visible packages in the src folder
